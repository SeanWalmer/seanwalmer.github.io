    "discrip": "This is an ongoing project still in very early alpha phases. This application will be a social platform for boardgame lovers. It is meant to help people who enjoy boardgames find others who would like to trade games so both parties donâ€™t need to go out and buy a whole new game. Boardgames are often very expensive and so users can save money by trading rather than buying new. This app serves a secondary purpose in connecting people who share a similar interest. Boardgames are an inherently social experience and often it can be hard to find other who you can play with! This app will have the secondary effect of making this process passive and easier!",
